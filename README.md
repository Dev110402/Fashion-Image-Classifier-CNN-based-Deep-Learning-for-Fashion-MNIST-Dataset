# Fashion-Image-Classifier-CNN-based-Deep-Learning-for-Fashion-MNIST-Dataset
Developed a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras for fashion image classification from Fashion MNIST dataset, consisting of 2 convolutional layers, flattening layer, and a dense layer with softmax activation.
Preprocessed dataset by reshaping images and performing one-hot encoding on target labels, preparing them for training and evaluation. Dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of size 28x28 grayscale.
Trained CNN model on Fashion MNIST dataset for 3 epochs using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Model achieved accuracy on validation set, showcasing skills in image classification and proficiency in TensorFlow and Keras.
